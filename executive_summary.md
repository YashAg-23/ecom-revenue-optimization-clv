# Executive Summary — Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding, predicting, and maximizing customer lifetime value (CLV) using real transactional data. By combining exploratory data analysis (EDA), RFM segmentation, and probabilistic CLV modeling, the goal was to help the business identify its most valuable customers, optimize retention strategies, and allocate marketing resources more effectively.

## Objectives
- Derive customer behavior insights through data-driven segmentation (RFM).  
- Build a BG/NBD model to predict expected future transactions.  
- Use a Gamma-Gamma model to estimate expected average profit per customer.  
- Calculate 6-month CLV and identify high-value customer segments.  
- Translate insights into actionable business strategies.

## Key Insights

### 1. Customer Segmentation (RFM)
- Customers were grouped into meaningful segments such as Champions, Loyal, Potential Loyalists, and At-Risk.
- Champions and Loyal Customers, though smaller in number, contributed disproportionately higher revenue.
- A large portion of customers belonged to At-Risk and Hibernating categories — representing potential re-engagement opportunities.

### 2. CLV Modeling Highlights
- The BG/NBD model estimated purchase frequency based on customer recency and transaction history.
- The Gamma-Gamma model captured the expected monetary value per transaction.
- The combined models produced an interpretable Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) metric for each customer.

| Model | Key Parameters | Interpretation |
|:------|:----------------|:----------------|
| BG/NBD | r = 0.23, a = 1.04, b = 1.28 | Defines transaction probability patterns |
| Gamma-Gamma | p = 11.21, q = 1.18, v = 10.91 | Defines expected profit per transaction |

### 3. Strategic CLV Insights
- The top 10% of customers contributed the majority of long-term value.  
- Low-frequency, high-value customers represent a key retention target.  
- Predictive models revealed clear churn and engagement opportunities when mapped across segments.

## Business Impact and Recommendations

| Strategic Area | Recommended Action | Expected Impact |
|:----------------|:------------------|:----------------|
| Retention | Prioritize retention programs for Champions & Loyal segments | Sustained revenue growth |
| Reactivation | Launch personalized win-back campaigns for At-Risk and Hibernating customers | Reactivate dormant value |
| Cross-Sell / Upsell | Use CLV predictions to identify mid-value customers with high potential | Increase customer profitability |
| Marketing Optimization | Reallocate marketing spend towards high CLV customers | Improved ROI |
| Customer Support | Offer priority service for top-tier customers | Strengthen loyalty & advocacy |

## Key Learnings
- Practical implementation of BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models for lifetime value estimation.  
- The power of RFM segmentation in identifying actionable customer clusters.  
- How data storytelling and model outputs can shape business strategy.  
- End-to-end data journey — from cleaning → modeling → insights → recommendations.

## Final Takeaway
Customer Lifetime Value analysis is not just about prediction — it’s about strategic foresight.  
This project demonstrates how businesses can use data to understand customers deeply, retain them smartly, and grow sustainably.
