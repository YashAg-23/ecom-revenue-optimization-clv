# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) & Revenue Optimization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** for an e-commerce business. Using **Python, RFM segmentation, and probabilistic models (BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma)**, we identify valuable customers, forecast revenue potential, and generate actionable insights for business growth.

---

## Objectives
- Derive customer behavior insights through **RFM segmentation**
- Predict future purchase frequency using the **BG/NBD model**
- Estimate expected average profit using the **Gamma-Gamma model**
- Calculate **6-month CLV** for each customer
- Recommend strategies for **retention, reactivation, and growth**

## Key Highlights
| Aspect | Tools / Methods Used |
|:-------|:---------------------|
| **Data Analysis & Cleaning** | Python (pandas, numpy) |
| **Segmentation** | RFM Analysis |
| **Predictive Modeling** | BG/NBD & Gamma-Gamma models (Lifetimes library) |
| **Visualization** | matplotlib, seaborn |
| **CLV Calculation** | 6-month forecasted value |
| **Insights Dashboard** | (Excel dashboard planned — in progress) |

---

## Strategic Recommendations
| Area | Action | Expected Impact |
|:------|:--------|:----------------|
| **Retention** | Focus on “Champions” and “Loyal” segments | Sustainable revenue growth |
| **Reactivation** | Win-back campaigns for “At-Risk” customers | Recover dormant value |
| **Upsell / Cross-sell** | Target “Potential Loyalists” with personalized offers | Increase profitability |
| **Marketing Spend** | Redirect towards high CLV customers | Improved ROI |

## Executive Summary
Customer Lifetime Value analysis is not just about prediction — it’s about **strategic foresight**.  
This project demonstrates how businesses can **use data to understand customers deeply, retain them smartly, and grow sustainably**.

> “The companies that win long-term are those that understand their customers better than anyone else.”
